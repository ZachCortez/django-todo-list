# django-todo-list
Python/Django based 'To Do list' web app.
My first attempt to creating a web app based off the basic CRUD commands in a 'todo_list' style project.
# Boots on Ground Prototype 
- Log In and Reg feautres for users and superusers (admins)
- Ability to create, delete, update, and view details of task.
- Will tweak and add more features and use of APIs
